# TaskMaster change log (I will delete it every other day, just to keep track of what I did the previous day)

* 11/9/2020
* Implemented intent filter
* Users can now select/share an image and taskmaster appears
* If a user clicks to share, they are directed to the add-task page
* The image is displayed at the add task, and is saved to that specific task
* Users can check by clicking the recycler to view the image (it takes awhile to load)

* 11/5/2020
* Added analytics to the app
* Currently tracking when users logout/login, when they direct to add-task page and when they load the main page.
